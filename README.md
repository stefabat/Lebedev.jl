A julia package to compute the [Lebedev quadrature rule](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lebedev_quadrature)
over the surface of a three-dimensional unit sphere.

This formula allows to approximate a surface integral as follows

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=I(f)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\int_0^\pi&space;f(\phi,\theta)\sin\theta&space;d\theta\approx4\pi\sum_iw_if(x_i,y_i,z_i)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I(f)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\int_0^\pi&space;f(\phi,\theta)\sin\theta&space;d\theta\approx4\pi\sum_iw_if(x_i,y_i,z_i)" title="I(f)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\int_0^\pi f(\phi,\theta)\sin\theta d\theta\approx4\pi\sum_iw_if(x_i,y_i,z_i)" /></a>

where the number of points in the sum depends on the quadrature order chosen.
The coefficients generated by the Lebedev rule allow to calculate integrals of polynomials

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x^ky^lz^m,\;k&plus;l&plus;m\le131" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x^ky^lz^m,\;k&plus;l&plus;m\le131" title="x^ky^lz^m,\;k+l+m\le131" /></a>

with, in principle, a relative accuracy in the order of 2⋅10⁻¹⁵. The points created by the rule
have octahedral rotation (Oₕ point group) and inversion symmetry, while the coefficients are
normalized such that they sum up to one.
